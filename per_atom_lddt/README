Run aa_local_lddt scoring on sets of targets and associated models.

First script: score_aa_local_lddt.py
This is set up to execute OST through a Singularity installation. For each
model of each target, it produces a .json file containing the OST scores.

Second script: compute_lddt_comparisons.py
This reads the .json files and the model PDB files, and compares the
pLDDT scores from the PDB files with the actual LDDT scores in the .json files.
These are collated into one CSV file per target.

The two ranking scripts don't require OST, but compute (alternatively) Z-scores
or means from the collections of .csv files produced by the previous step.
